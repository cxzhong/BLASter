- `check-documentation`: Documentation structure and content validation
- `benchmark-examples`: Comprehensive performance testing and reporting
- `check-links`: Documentation link validation
- `documentation-summary`: Summary report generation

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Required Secrets

For the release workflow to publish to PyPI, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. **PyPI API Token:**
   ```
   PYPI_API_TOKEN
   ```
   - Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
   - Generate an API token for your project
   - Add it to GitHub Secrets

2. **Test PyPI API Token (Optional):**
   ```
   TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN  
   ```
   - Go to [Test PyPI Account Settings](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/)
   - Generate an API token for testing
   - Add it to GitHub Secrets

### Environments

The workflows use GitHub Environments for additional security:

- `pypi` environment for production PyPI publishing
- `test-pypi` environment for test PyPI publishing

Create these environments in your repository settings and add the respective API tokens.

## üìã Workflow Features

### Automatic Eigen3 Testing
All workflows specifically test the automatic Eigen3 download feature by intentionally NOT installing system Eigen3 packages. This validates that users can install BLASter without manual dependency management.

### Matrix Testing Strategy
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests key Python versions (3.10-3.13) on major platforms
- **Selective Exclusions:** Reduces CI time while maintaining good coverage
- **Failure Isolation:** `fail-fast: false` ensures all combinations are tested

### Artifact Collection
Workflows automatically collect and upload:
- Built wheels and source distributions
- Security and quality analysis reports  
- Performance benchmarking results
- Documentation validation summaries

### Performance Monitoring
- Automated performance benchmarking on main branch
- Performance characteristics reporting
- Regression detection through consistent testing

## üîç Monitoring and Maintenance

### Workflow Status
Monitor workflow status in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

### Artifact Downloads
All generated reports and build artifacts are available for download from completed workflow runs.

### Scheduled Scans
Security scans run weekly to catch new vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Manual Triggers
All workflows support manual dispatch for testing and debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Modifying Python Versions
Update the `python-version` matrix in each workflow to add/remove Python versions.

### Platform Support
Modify the `os` matrix to change supported platforms. Note that cibuildwheel in the release workflow controls wheel platforms.

### Security Tools
Add or remove security scanning tools in `quality.yml` based on your needs.

### Performance Thresholds
Modify performance benchmark criteria in the documentation workflow.

## üìö Best Practices

1. **Branch Protection:** Enable branch protection rules requiring workflow passes
2. **Review Requirements:** Require PR reviews before merging
3. **Status Checks:** Require specific workflows to pass before merging
4. **Automated Releases:** Use semantic versioning for automatic releases
5. **Security Monitoring:** Review security scan results regularly

## üéØ Workflow Optimization

The workflows are designed for:
- **Fast Feedback:** Critical tests run first
- **Resource Efficiency:** Selective testing matrices
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Security, quality, functionality, and documentation
- **Professional Standards:** Industry-standard tools and practices

This CI/CD setup ensures BLASter maintains high quality, security, and reliability standards while providing users with seamless installation and usage experience across all supported platforms.
